    "Pneumonia": "Identify areas in the chest X-ray where you see irregular, patchy, or fuzzy textures, especially around the lung regions. Look for any sections that appear significantly denser or have a cloud-like appearance compared to the rest of the lung area. Note any asymmetry in lung appearance, where one lung might look different from the other in terms of texture and density. Avoid regions that are uniformly clear or show normal rib and spine outlines without any overlapping textures.",
    "Pulmonary Edema" : "Identify images showing widespread fluffy or cloud-like opacities, especially in the central parts of the lungs. Look for instances where these opacities obscure the normal lung markings. Exclude images where the lung fields are clear and well-defined, with visible, normal vascular and bronchial structures.",
    "Pleural Effusion" : "Identify images showing an increased opacity in the lower lung regions, particularly on one side. Look for signs where the normally sharp lung border against the chest wall appears blurred or less distinct. Check for any visible fluid levels within this opacity. Exclude images where both lung fields are clear and the borders of the lungs against the chest wall are sharply defined.",
    "Atelectasis" : "Identify images where the lung area shows uneven brightness with patches of increased whiteness, particularly around the lower regions. Look for areas where the lung texture appears more solid than the typical spongy look. Exclude images where the lung field is uniformly transparent and the lung texture is evenly spongy throughout. Focus on detecting irregularities in lung transparency and texture consistency.",
    "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)" : "Identify images where the lung area shows irregular, patchy textures, unlike the uniform, smooth textures seen in normal lung areas. Look for areas where the lung fields appear more prominent or inflated compared to normal, with less distinct heart and diaphragm outlines. Avoid selecting images with clear, well-defined lung fields and sharp outlines of the heart and diaphragm.",
    "Lung Nodule" : "Identify areas in the chest X-ray where there are small, round, or oval shapes that stand out from the surrounding lung area. Look for spots that appear more solid or dense compared to the rest of the lung, which is usually more transparent. Avoid considering normal structures like bones or the heart. Focus on finding isolated or clustered circular shapes in the lung fields.",
    "Pneumothorax" : "Identify the presence of a large, clear space without lung markings, typically at the top area of the lung. Look for a sharp, defined edge where the lung has collapsed, creating a visible line distinct from the surrounding lung area. Observe any shift in the position of the heart or trachea, which might appear pushed away from the clear space. Check for absence of the usual texture and patterns seen in healthy lung tissue in this clear space.",
    "Cardiomegaly" : "Identify an enlarged heart shape in the chest X-ray image. Look for a heart silhouette that appears significantly larger compared to the lung area, with a rounded or bulging outline towards the left side of the image. The heart's size should be noticeably bigger than the usual heart size in a typical chest X-ray, taking up more space in the chest cavity. The lung fields should appear clear, without any significant shadows or markings that indicate congestion or fluid.",
    "Tuberculosis" : "Identify and highlight areas in the chest X-ray where there are irregular, clustered white spots or patches. Look for zones where the texture appears uneven compared to the surrounding lung area, with a focus on the upper portion of the lungs. Also, identify any areas where the lung field seems to be shrunken or has lost its usual clarity. Exclude regions that appear uniformly grey and clear, typical for normal lung images.",
    "Fibrosis" : "Identify and highlight areas in the chest X-ray where you observe the following features: increased density or thickness, prominent lines or patterns that resemble a 'honeycomb' or 'reticular' structure, areas where the normal lung markings are obscured or less visible, and regions where the texture appears irregular compared to the surrounding lung tissue. Avoid considering areas that look uniform in texture and density, similar to typical lung images without any distinct patterns or irregularities.",
    "Lung Cancer" : "Identify images where there are irregular, asymmetrical shapes or clusters in the lung areas. Look for spots that appear more opaque or solid compared to the surrounding lung tissue, especially if these spots are uneven in texture. Note any areas where the lung's usual patterns and lines seem disrupted or obscured. Exclude images where the lung areas are clear, with no visible spots, clusters, or disruptions in the normal lung patterns.",
    "Rib Fractures" : "Identify images where ribs in the chest X-ray show distinct linear patterns or noticeable discontinuities. Look for ribs that appear to have sharp, irregular lines or breaks, different from the smooth, curved lines seen in normal ribs. Exclude images where all rib structures are uniformly smooth and uninterrupted. Focus on identifying images with ribs that have noticeable jagged or disjointed lines, which are not typical in normal X-rays.",
    "Mass" : "Identify areas in the chest X-ray image where you observe an unusual circular or oval shape that stands out from the surrounding lung area. Look for regions that have a denser appearance compared to the rest of the lung fields. Focus on noticeable differences in texture or density within these shapes, without considering the usual lung markings. Avoid areas that look similar to the rest of the lung fields and have regular lung patterns."
